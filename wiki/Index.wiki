I keep on posting in my blog http://thinkinginsoftware.blogspot.com and in here. Navigating through the SVN you should get code that works. Reading this WIKi and my blog should be enough to get a feeling of some of those projects I have been involved and I am able to share.

It is my hope that others while reading should share as well, not only comments on the subjects here discussed but also code that works on their own blogs and WIKIs.
