 * BGAGFNTP: I have started with "Beginning Groovy and Grails: From Novice to Professional" which you can buy in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210451/ref=cm_rdp_product. While learning from this book I have been playing with vim, cream and groovy Eclipse plugin so far. Debugging has been a challenge BTW (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-2208)
