= Web Development =

After several years of programming for the Web I am still looking for the ideal WEB framework ;-) I even built my own one (http://thinkinginsoftware.blogspot.com/). Currently I am testing Rails and Grails.


= Grails =
To check in Grails projects into svn read this article http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/Checking+Projects+into+SVN

== collab-todo ==
Maintained in http://nestorurquiza.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/collab-todo/ I have started with "Beginning Groovy and Grails: From Novice to Professional" which you can buy in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210451/ref=cm_rdp_product. While learning from this book I have been playing with vim, cream and groovy Eclipse plugin so far. Debugging has been a challenge BTW (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-2208) and after chapter 5 it was imposible for me to continue adding more code. I found explanations incomplete basically.

Disclaimer: I am not hosting the source code that comes with the book but instead I am just reading the book and while making changes to the code I keep updating it on SVN so I can check out in different machines. If this action is illegal by any means please send me an email and I will remove the project.

=== SVN ===
 Here is how I have checked in:
 {{{
 cd collab-todo
 svn checkout https://nestorurquiza.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/collab-todo/ .
 svn add *
 svn propset svn:ignore "bin-groovy" .
 svn propset svn:ignore "stacktrace.log" .
 svn propset svn:ignore "classes" web-app/WEB-INF
 svn commit -m "First commit"
 }}}
 Since I am using 'junction' in Windows to create symlinks and 'bin-groovy' points to WEB-INF/classes I had to repeat some of the commands:
 {{{
 svn add web-app/WEB-INF/*
 svn commit -m "First commit"
 }}}

=== MYSQL ===
I have worked for development using MySQL instead of HSQLDB:
 1. Download the driver from http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.tar.gz/from/pick#mirrors and put the jar file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-bin.jar) it in the Grails lib folder.
 1. Edit DataSource.groovy:
 {{{
 development {
	dataSource {			
		driverClassName = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
	        username = "root"
	        password = ""
	        dbCreate = "update"
	        url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/collab_todo_dev"
	}
 }
 }}}
 Note we use "create-drop" and so if you started coding with HSQLDB you will end up with all your domain changes in place in MySQL after a "grails run-app"
 1. Create the dev db
 {{{
 create database collab_todo_dev 
 }}}
