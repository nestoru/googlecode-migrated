This project is a proof of concept showing how to interact with Exchange Web Services from Java. There are two ways to achieve that goal: Managed and Unmanaged code.

The code related to the managed API is just a main Java class illustrating the use of the Microsoft ewsjavaapi package.

The code related to EWS through Web Services (Unmanaged API) has resulted from several hours of research, try and error. It is not by any means a library but rather a proof of concept that just shows folder creation, getting info from Inbox and sending an email while saving it in a subfolder.

Take a look at http://thinkinginsoftware.blogspot.com/2011/02/exchange-web-services-ews-from-java.html for more explanation

You will notice how I attempted to use the abandoned EWS Java API published by Microsoft on  http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/ewsjavaapi. The traces of that attempt are commented out in this project just for historical reasons 

1. A copy of the wsdl and xsd files can be found in the main/resources directory
2. Modify EwsSettings so you point to the path to a properties file in a local folder.
3. The content of the properties file would be clear if you examine the class. Here is an example:
#
# EWS
#

# Path to Services.wsdl file. Both messages.xsd and types.xsd must be in the same folder together with Services.wsdl
ews.wsdlPath=file:/Users/nestor/Downloads/Services.wsdl

# Value of wsdl:service@name
ews.serviceStubName=ExchangeService

# Sensitive data]
ews.userName=myuser@mycompany.microsoftonline.com
ews.password=mypassword
